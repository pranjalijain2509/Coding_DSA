#Some functions on deque

from collections import deque
#we have made a prefined deque
d=deque([10,20,30,40])
print(d)
#by this way we can print an element of deque 
#name of the queue and then the index number of the element
print(d[2])
#we can modify the value of any value
#fetch the elment by the index no and then provide the updated value
d[2]=233
print(d)
#print the first element of the deque
print(d[0])
#print the last element of the deque
print(d[-1])
