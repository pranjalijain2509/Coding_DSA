#Balanced search tree-
#If we do traversal in inorder manner it will always give it in sorted order
#For every node key in left side are smaller and keys in right are greater
#All keys are distinct
#They are linked data structure
#If we have a balanced BST then search,insert,delete,find closet in big o(n) 
#But if it is a skewed tree then it takes big o(h) where h is height
