#Some functions on deque

from collections import deque
#we have made a prefined deque
d=deque([10,20,30,40])
print(d)
#"rotate" function rotates the deque but since value is positive so it is rotated clockwise
d.rotate(2)
print(d)
#"rotate" function rotates the deque but since value is negative so it is rotated anti clockwise
d.rotate(-3)
print(d)

Output-

deque([10, 20, 30, 40])
deque([30, 40, 10, 20])
deque([20, 30, 40, 10])
